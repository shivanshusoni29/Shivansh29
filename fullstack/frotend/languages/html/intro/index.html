            <p>HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is a markup language for
             the web that defines the structure of web pages. It is one of 
             the most basic building blocks of every website, so it's crucial
             to learn if you want to have a career in web development. In this 
             article, I will walk you through what HTML is about in detail, how
             it does things on web pages, and we'll also touch on a really cool 
             part of HTML: Semantic HTML.</p>
